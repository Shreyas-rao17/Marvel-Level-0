# Google Bard - An Easy Guide
Google Bard is an AI-powered chatbot designed by Google. Bard uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to simulate human conversation.  
The chatbot is trained on a vast database of text, code, and images. Bard also has access to current information directly from the web.  
This way, you can use Bard as a personal AI assistant to help with a number of tasks, such as replying to emails, writing marketing content, translating documents, summarizing meeting notes, and much more.  
With Bard, Google has entered the rapidly growing generative AI market which is expected to reach USD 51.8 billion by 2028.  
## What is Google Bard?
Google Bard is an advanced, AI-powered conversational chatbot. Bard is powered by a new generation of large language models (LLM) that are trained on datasets of text, code, and images.

Google positions Bard as a helpful collaborator. You can type in a prompt and Bard will tap into current events and information from the web and come up with a structured answer.  
> ### This way Bard aligns with Google’s mission of making knowledge accessible and useful.
## When was Google Bard released?
Google Bard was first released on February 2023, in a statement by the Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai. That day, Bard opened up only to trusted testers.  
A couple of weeks later, on March 21, 2023, Bard was released to the public in the US and UK. By July 2023, Bard became available in over 240 countries and territories and in more than 40 languages.  
The chatbot is constantly learning and improving. So far, Bard has introduced nine updates. Some important updates include:  
* April 2023: Bard can help you code in 20+ programming languages.
* May 2023: Google announced that Bard had adopted PaLM 2, a more advanced large language model. Bard is now available in three languages in over 180 countries.
* July 2023: Bard becomes available in over 40 new languages and expands in more countries, including all 27 EU countries and Brazil. You can now use Google Lens in Bard to upload images. Bard also gains text-to-speech capabilities in over 40 languages.
## How does Google Bard work?
Bard is powered by the Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2), Google’s newest large language model. PaLM 2 is trained on a large dataset of text, code, and images.

This gives Bard the ability to understand the world better and handle advanced reasoning tasks, multilingual translation, and natural language generation. 
Before switching to PaLM 2, Bard was initially powered by Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA).
## Is Google Bard reliable?
Google Bard is not always fully reliable. The chatbot is still an experiment, so it may provide inaccurate or misleading information.

These are known as AI hallucinations. 

Bard learns by being exposed to data. When you interact with Bard, Google collects data on your conversation, usage information, and feedback.

You can give Bard a thumbs up or a thumbs down on each answer.

Google uses the data to improve and develop its products and machine learning technologies. So the more people that use Bard and provide feedback, the better the chatbot will get at giving correct information. 

You can go around this limitation using the Google it bar inside Bard to start a Google search on the topic of your prompt.
